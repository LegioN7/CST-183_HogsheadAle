Overview & Instructions
In the world of Harry Potter, a Hogsmeade pub owner needs to replenish their stocks of ale and must work
with muggles to make the deal. The negotiations conclude and a price for a number of hogheads of ale is
agreed upon for a given price in U.S. dollars.


Your program should summarize the transaction. Input should include:
● Number of hogsheads of ale (integer)
● Dollar amount agreed upon per hogshead (decimal)
● Distance from Hogsmeade (miles)
Output for the program should be a summary of various totals in different units (both muggle and wizarding).

Here is a the expected output:
Amount: xx hogsheads, xxx.x gallons
Delivery Time: xx.x hours
Cost: xxxx.xx U.S. Dollars
xxxx.xx Euros
xxxx.xx British Pounds
xx galleons, xx sickles, xx knuts

Your general formatting can vary but be sure to include all of the demonstrated values. Format gallons to
one decimal place, monetary amounts to two decimal places, and be sure that the hogsheads and wizarding
money values are integers.


Required facts include the following:
The monetary exchange rate between the wizarding and muggle worlds is:
● There are 54 U.S. gallons in one hogshead
● 1 Galleon = $25.50
● 1 Dollar = 0.86 Euros = 0.76 Pounds
● 1 Galleon = 17 Sickles
● 1 Sickle = 29 Knuts
● Your delivery vehicle travels at 80 kph


Include exclusive use of dialog-based input and output for this solution. You are free of course to integrate
use of the Java console for testing, but be sure the final solution utilizes dialog boxes. Design your input
dialogs to include clear instructions and make sure your output dialog is organized, understandable, and
includes proper units.

Be sure to consider documentation, code structure, neatness, and clarity in your final solution.
